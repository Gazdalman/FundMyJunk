# Welcome To FundMyJunk:
### Where Philanthropy and Terrible Ideas Meet

</div>

<div>
Do you have an idea SO big and SO unique that those chumps at Kickstarter wouldn't fund it? Do your friends and loved ones look at you is disgust and ask "When are you going to get a real job and stop pushing pyramid schemes?" What if I told you they can suck an egg? We here at FundMyJunkâ„¢ believe in the value of EVERY idea and have funded quite a few. Here's a couple examples. The My First Nuclear Power Plant for kids, the Stainless Steel Parachute, and the Elon Musk Twitter Rebranding. Banger after banger! So what are you waiting for? <a href="https://fundmyjunk.onrender.com">Go fund yourself!</a>
